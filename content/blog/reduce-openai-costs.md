# How to Reduce OpenAI API Costs by 40% Without Sacrificing Quality

If you're building with OpenAI's API, you've probably noticed the costs adding up fast. A single GPT-4 call can cost $0.03-0.06, and at scale, that becomes thousands per month.

The good news? You can cut these costs by 40% or more without sacrificing quality. Here's how.

## 1. Smart Model Routing

Not every request needs GPT-4. Many tasks work perfectly with GPT-3.5-turbo at 1/10th the cost.

**Example:**
- Simple classification → GPT-3.5-turbo
- Complex reasoning → GPT-4
- Code generation → GPT-4
- Summarization → GPT-3.5-turbo

```javascript
import { CostLens } from 'costlens';

const client = new CostLens({
  apiKey: process.env.OPTIRELAY_API_KEY,
  routing: 'smart' // Automatically routes to optimal model
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4', // CostLens may route to gpt-3.5 if appropriate
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize this article' }]
});
```

**Savings: 30-50% on average**

## 2. Response Caching

Identical requests shouldn't cost you twice. Cache responses for common queries.

```javascript
const client = new CostLens({
  apiKey: process.env.OPTIRELAY_API_KEY,
  cache: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: 3600 // 1 hour
  }
});
```

**Savings: 20-40% for apps with repeated queries**

## 3. Prompt Optimization

Shorter prompts = fewer tokens = lower costs.

**Before (150 tokens):**
```
You are a helpful assistant. Please analyze the following text and provide a detailed summary. Make sure to include all the key points and be thorough in your analysis. Here is the text: [...]
```

**After (50 tokens):**
```
Summarize key points: [...]
```

**Savings: 10-20% on input tokens**

## 4. Batch Processing

Process multiple requests together to reduce overhead.

```javascript
const results = await client.batch([
  { model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', messages: [...] },
  { model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', messages: [...] },
  { model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', messages: [...] }
]);
```

**Savings: 5-15% on API overhead**

## Real Results

One of our customers reduced their monthly OpenAI bill from $12,000 to $7,200 using these strategies. That's $4,800/month saved, or $57,600/year.
