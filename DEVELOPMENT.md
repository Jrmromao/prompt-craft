# Development Guidelines

## End-of-Day Rule

Before marking any day's work as complete, you MUST:

1. **Run tests**: `yarn test`
2. **Build the app**: `yarn build`
3. **Verify both pass** - fix any failures before proceeding

This ensures we catch issues early and maintain production readiness throughout development.

## Commands

- `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `yarn test` - Run test suite
- `yarn build` - Production build
- `yarn start` - Start production server
