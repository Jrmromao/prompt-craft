**Tests:** 3  
**Coverage:** Basic rendering only

- ✅ Renders for free users with upgrade prompt
- ✅ Renders for paid users
- ✅ Shows upgrade button for PRO plan

**Status:** ⚠️ Minimal coverage - needs expansion

---

### 2. Integration Tests
**File:** `__tests__/integration/playground-flow.test.tsx`  
**Tests:** 5  
**Coverage:** End-to-end workflows

- ✅ Complete full prompt testing workflow
- ✅ Multi-model comparison
- ✅ Error recovery and retry
- ✅ Performance under load
- ✅ State persistence

**Status:** ✅ Good coverage

---

### 3. API Tests
**File:** `__tests__/api/playground.test.ts`  
**Tests:** Unknown  
**Coverage:** AI Service integration

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs review

## 🎯 Coverage Gaps

### Missing Tests:
- [ ] Prompt input validation
- [ ] Copy functionality
- [ ] History management
- [ ] Settings configuration
- [ ] Error handling (detailed)
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Credit system integration
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Recommended Additions:

**Expand Component Tests** (`__tests__/components/playground.test.tsx`):
```typescript
// Add these tests:
- Prompt input and validation
- Copy to clipboard
- History save/load
- Settings persistence
- Error messages
- Loading states
- Credit cost display
```

**Keep Integration Tests** (`__tests__/integration/playground-flow.test.tsx`):
- ✅ Already comprehensive
- No changes needed

---

## ✅ Action Plan

### 1. Expand Existing Component Test
**File:** `__tests__/components/playground.test.tsx`  
**Add:** 15-20 more tests for full coverage

### 2. Keep Integration Tests
**File:** `__tests__/integration/playground-flow.test.tsx`  
**Status:** Already good ✅

### 3. Review & Consolidate
- Check if `__tests__/playground.test.ts` duplicates `__tests__/services/aiService.playground.test.ts`
- Merge if duplicate
- Remove redundant tests

---

## 🚫 Avoid Creating:

- ❌ `__tests__/unit/Playground.test.tsx` (would duplicate component test)
- ❌ New integration test (already exists)
- ❌ Duplicate service tests

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Expand** `__tests__/components/playground.test.tsx` from 3 to 20+ tests
2. **Review** existing API and E2E tests
3. **Consolidate** duplicate service tests
4. **Document** what each test file covers

---

**Summary:** We have good integration tests, but component tests need expansion. Don't create duplicates!
