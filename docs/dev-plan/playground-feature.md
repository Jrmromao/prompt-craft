# Playground Feature Development Plan

## Overview
The Playground feature allows users to test prompts interactively. It will be available as both a dedicated page (`/playground`) and a reusable component for integration in prompt creation and detail pages.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Dedicated Playground Page
- [x] Create `app/playground/page.tsx` with prompt input, run button, and output display.
- [x] Wire up to `/api/ai/run` endpoint for LLM execution.

### 2. Reusable Playground Component
- [x] Refactor the playground logic into a reusable component (e.g., `components/Playground.tsx`).
- [x] Accept props for initial prompt, disabled state, and callback for result.

### 3. Integrate Playground in Prompt Create Page
- [x] Add a "Test in Playground" or "Try Prompt" button to the prompt creation UI (`app/prompts/create/ClientPromptCreate.tsx`).
- [x] Open the playground component in a modal or inline for testing.

### 4. Integrate Playground in Prompt Detail Page
- [x] Add a "Test this Prompt" button to the prompt detail UI.
- [x] Open the playground component with the selected prompt pre-filled.

### 5. Usage Limits & Tier Integration
- [x] Check user tier and usage before allowing prompt runs.
- [x] Show remaining runs and upsell if the limit is reached.

### 6. QA & Build
- [ ] Test all flows (page, modal, inline) for UX and error handling.
- [ ] Run `yarn build` to ensure the app is not broken.
- [ ] Mark this plan as complete in this doc after successful build.

- [x] Reusable Playground component created and integrated in the page.
- [x] Playground integrated in prompt create and detail pages.
- [x] Usage limits/tier integration complete.
