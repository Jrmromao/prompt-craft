### Ideas for Pricing Tiers & Features

**1. Free Tier: Community Explorer**

- **Target Audience:** New users, students, hobbyists, those exploring prompt engineering, individuals who primarily want to _consume_ prompts and get a feel for the community.
- **Price:** €0/month
- **Core Value:** Discover and engage with the community's best prompts.
- **Features:**
  - **Browse & Search Community Prompts:** Full access to view and search all public, community-submitted prompts.
  - **View Rankings & Features:** See top-performing and curated prompts.
  - **Basic Community Interaction:** Upvote/downvote prompts, leave comments.
  - **Limited Public Prompt Submissions:** E.g., 2-3 public prompt submissions per month. This encourages contribution but limits potential spam.
  - **Limited Basic Testing Playground Runs:** A small number of runs (e.g., 10-20 per month) using your default API integration. This allows testing of community prompts but incentivizes paid for heavy usage.
  - **Limited Private Prompt Storage:** E.g., 5-10 private prompts.
  - **Basic User Profile:** For contributions and reputation.

**2. Lite Tier: Personal Prompt Engineer**

- **Target Audience:** Individual prompt engineers, freelancers, and AI enthusiasts who need more capacity for personal prompt management and testing. They value efficiency and personal organization.
- **Price:** €9 - €15 per month (a good low-cost entry point for paid users)
- **Core Value:** Enhance individual prompt creation, testing, and organization.
- **Features:**
  - **All Free Tier Features.**
  - **Increased Public Prompt Submissions:** E.g., 20-30 public prompt submissions per month.
  - **Generous Private Prompt Storage:** E.g., 200-300 private prompts.
  - **Increased Testing Playground Runs:** E.g., 200-300 runs per month.
  - **Basic Prompt Analytics:** Simple insights on their own prompt performance (e.g., average upvotes, usage count).
  - **Basic Prompt Forking:** Ability to copy and modify community prompts.
  - **Standard Email Support.**

**3. Pro Tier: Power User & Solo Creator**

- **Target Audience:** Dedicated prompt engineers, professional content creators, developers, and serious AI users who require advanced capabilities, extensive testing, and direct control over their prompt interactions.
- **Price:** €29 - €39 per month (this aligns with your previous "Pro" tier idea and market rates)
- **Core Value:** Maximize prompt performance, efficiency, and integration for professional use.
- **Features:**
  - **All Lite Tier Features.**
  - **Unlimited Public Prompt Submissions.**
  - **Unlimited Private Prompt Storage.**
  - **Extensive Testing Playground Runs:** E.g., 1,000 - 2,000 runs per month (or even "unlimited" with fair usage policy).
  - **Bring Your Own API Key:** Crucial feature. Users can connect their own API keys for premium LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro). This offloads your LLM costs for their heavy usage.
  - **Advanced Prompt Analytics:** Deeper insights into prompt effectiveness, cost per prompt, and performance over time.
  - **Full Prompt Versioning:** Track changes to your prompts over time with rollback capabilities.
  - **Priority Support.**
  - **Early Access to New Features:** Get a head start on upcoming functionalities.

### Why this structure works:

- **Clear Value Progression:** Each tier offers a clear step up in capabilities, justifying the price increase.
- **Address Different Needs:**
  - Free users are explorers and community contributors.
  - Lite users are individual users who need more capacity than free.
  - Pro users are power users who rely on prompts professionally and need advanced tools.
- **Monetization Funnel:** The free tier attracts users, the Lite tier captures those with growing individual needs, and the Pro tier caters to serious users who derive significant value and need more robust tools.
- **Cost Management (for you):** Pushing heavy LLM usage onto the user's own API key in the Pro tier is vital for managing your infrastructure costs, especially as a solo developer.

You can also introduce a "Team" tier later, as discussed in the previous roadmap, once you have established a solid base with these initial three tiers. This allows you to focus on the core value proposition first.
