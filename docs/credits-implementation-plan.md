# Engineering Plan: V1 Credit System Implementation

> **Critical Notice**: This implementation is mission-critical for our app's economy and user retention. The credit system must be implemented flawlessly to maintain user trust and ensure accurate monetization.

## Overview

Our app is a beloved tool that users rely on daily. The new credit system must feel seamless and fair, maintaining the trust we've built while enabling sustainable growth. This implementation will introduce a dual-credit system:

- **Monthly Credits**: Non-cumulative credits that reset monthly (Free/Pro users)
- **Purchased Credits**: Non-expiring credits that can be bought by Free/Pro users

## Technical Stack & Constraints

- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Package Manager**: Yarn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Architecture**: Service-based (no direct DB calls in components)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Models

- [ ] **Schema Updates**
  - [ ] Add `monthlyCredits` and `purchasedCredits` to User model
  - [ ] Add `lastMonthlyReset` timestamp to User model
  - [ ] Update CreditHistory model to track credit source
  - [ ] Add indexes for performance optimization

- [ ] **Migration Planning**
  - [ ] Create migration strategy for existing users
  - [ ] Plan data backfill for credit history
  - [ ] Generate and test migration scripts

### Phase 2: Core Services Implementation

- [ ] **CreditService Enhancement**
  - [ ] Implement `deductCredits` with monthly-first logic
  - [ ] Add `addPurchasedCredits` function
  - [ ] Create `getCreditBalance` method
  - [ ] Implement transaction safety checks

- [ ] **Monthly Reset System**
  - [ ] Create `MonthlyCreditResetService`
  - [ ] Implement cron job for credit resets
  - [ ] Add monitoring and alerting
  - [ ] Create rollback procedures

### Phase 3: API Layer

- [ ] **Credit Balance Endpoints**
  - [ ] Create `/api/credits/balance` GET endpoint
  - [ ] Implement `/api/credits/purchase` POST endpoint
  - [ ] add audiLogs where appropriet

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Define error response structure
  - [ ] Implement proper error logging
  - [ ] Add request validation

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration

- [ ] **Credit Balance Hook**
  - [ ] Create `useCreditBalance` hook
  - [ ] Implement real-time updates
  - [ ] Add error handling and loading states

- [ ] **UI Components**
  - [ ] Update credit display in navigation
  - [ ] Create credit purchase modal
  - [ ] Add credit usage notifications
  - [ ] Implement credit balance tooltips

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Test CreditService methods
  - [ ] Test API endpoints
  - [ ] Test frontend components
  - [ ] Test monthly reset logic

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Test credit purchase flow
  - [ ] Test credit deduction flow
  - [ ] Test monthly reset process
  - [ ] Test error scenarios

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - [ ] Load test credit operations
  - [ ] Test concurrent credit deductions
  - [ ] Verify database performance

### Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring

- [ ] **Deployment Planning**
  - [ ] Create deployment checklist
  - [ ] Plan database migration timing
  - [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
  - [ ] Schedule maintenance window

- [ ] **Monitoring Setup**
  - [ ] Add credit system metrics
  - [ ] Set up alerts for anomalies
  - [ ] Create monitoring dashboard
  - [ ] Implement logging strategy

## Critical Considerations

### Data Integrity
- All credit operations must be atomic
- Implement proper transaction handling
- Maintain audit trail of all credit changes

### User Experience
- Clear communication of credit status
- Intuitive purchase flow
- Transparent credit usage

### Security
- Validate all credit operations
- Prevent credit manipulation
- Secure purchase endpoints

### Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Implement proper caching
- Handle high concurrency

## Success Metrics

- Zero credit calculation errors
- < 100ms response time for credit operations
- 99.9% uptime for credit system
- < 0.1% error rate in credit transactions

## Rollback Plan

1. Database rollback procedure
2. Service rollback steps
3. Frontend rollback process
4. Communication plan for users

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 2 days
- Phase 2: 3 days
- Phase 3: 2 days
- Phase 4: 3 days
- Phase 5: 3 days
- Phase 6: 2 days

Total: 15 days

## Team Responsibilities

- Backend Team: Database, Services, API
- Frontend Team: UI Components, Hooks
- DevOps: Deployment, Monitoring
- QA: Testing, Validation
- Product: User Experience, Communication

## Communication Plan

1. Internal team updates
2. User communication strategy
3. Documentation updates
4. Support team training
