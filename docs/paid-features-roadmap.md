# Paid Features Roadmap - Based on User Feedback

## User's Brutal Assessment Summary

**Would pay for:** Features that **actively save money**
**Won't pay for:** Analytics, tracking, enterprise fluff

---

## ‚úÖ TIER 1: Core Features (Build First) - $50/month

### 1. AI-Powered Prompt Optimization Engine
**User would pay: $50/month** (saves $200/month)

```typescript
const optimized = await promptCraft.optimizePrompt({
  original: "Write a professional email about the quarterly report",
  targetCost: 0.05,
  quality: "high"
});
// Returns: 78% cost reduction, 92% quality maintained
```

**Implementation:**
- Use GPT-4 to analyze and rewrite prompts for efficiency
- Test output quality against original
- Return optimized version with cost/quality metrics
- Cache optimization results

**Value Proposition:**
- 50-80% cost reduction
- Quality preservation (90%+ maintained)
- Clear ROI: Saves $200, costs $50
- Time savings: No manual optimization

**Technical Approach:**
1. Analyze prompt structure and complexity
2. Identify redundant instructions
3. Rewrite for clarity and brevity
4. Test with cheaper models
5. Validate quality matches original
6. Return best cost/quality ratio

---

### 2. Smart Model Selection
**User would pay: $30/month** (saves $100/month)

```typescript
const result = await promptCraft.smartCall({
  prompt: "Write a professional email",
  quality: "high",
  maxCost: 0.10
});
// Automatically picks cheapest viable model
```

**Implementation:**
- Test prompt with multiple models
- Compare quality scores
- Select cheapest model meeting quality threshold
- Cache model selection decisions

**Value Proposition:**
- Automatic optimization
- Always picks cheapest viable option
- Quality assurance built-in
- Zero configuration

**Technical Approach:**
1. Run prompt on 3-5 models (parallel)
2. Score output quality (similarity, coherence, accuracy)
3. Calculate cost per quality point
4. Select best value model
5. Cache decision for similar prompts

---

### 3. Real-Time Cost Control
**User would pay: $25/month** (prevents overruns)

```typescript
const promptCraft = new PromptCraft({
  budget: {
    daily: 50,
    monthly: 1000,
    autoSwitch: true  // Auto-switch to cheaper models near limit
  }
});
```

**Implementation:**
- Track real-time spending
- Alert at 80% budget
- Auto-switch to cheaper models at 90%
- Block requests at 100%

**Value Proposition:**
- Budget protection
- Peace of mind
- Automatic model switching
- Essential for production

**Technical Approach:**
1. Track spending in real-time (Redis)
2. Calculate remaining budget
3. Adjust model selection based on budget
4. Send alerts via webhook/email
5. Graceful degradation (cheaper models)

## ü§∑ TIER 2: Nice-to-Have Features - $20/month

### 4. Predictive Cost Analytics
**User would pay: $20/month**

```typescript
const forecast = await promptCraft.forecast({
  currentUsage: userData,
  timeframe: '30d'
});
// Returns: $2,500 predicted cost + recommendations
```

**Implementation:**
- Analyze usage patterns
- Project future costs
- Recommend optimizations
- Show ROI of changes

---

### 5. Smart Prompt Library
**User would pay: $15/month**

```typescript
// AI-powered prompt management
// Auto-categorization, quality scoring, version control
```

**Implementation:**
- Store prompts with metadata
- Auto-categorize by use case
- Score quality and cost
- Version control with diffs

## üöÄ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Smart Model Selection
**Why first:**
- Easiest to build
- Immediate value
- No AI optimization needed
- Can charge $30/month

**MVP:**
```typescript
// Test prompt on 3 models, pick cheapest that meets quality threshold
const result = await promptCraft.smartCall({
  prompt: "...",
  quality: "high"
});
```

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Real-Time Cost Control
**Why second:**
- Essential for production
- Builds on smart selection
- Can charge $50/month (Starter + Pro)

**MVP:**
```typescript
// Track spending, auto-switch models near limit
const promptCraft = new PromptCraft({
  budget: { daily: 50, monthly: 1000, autoSwitch: true }
});
```

### Phase 3 (Week 5-8): AI Prompt Optimization
**Why third:**
- Most complex
- Highest value ($50/month alone)
- Requires quality validation

**MVP:**
```typescript
// Use GPT-4 to optimize prompts for cost
const optimized = await promptCraft.optimizePrompt({
  original: "...",
  targetCost: 0.05
});
```

## üí∞ Revenue Projections

### Conservative (100 users):
```
50 users @ $30/month (Starter) = $1,500
30 users @ $50/month (Pro) = $1,500
20 users @ $100/month (Enterprise) = $2,000

Total: $5,000/month = $60,000/year
```

### Optimistic (500 users):
```
250 users @ $30/month = $7,500
150 users @ $50/month = $7,500
100 users @ $100/month = $10,000

Total: $25,000/month = $300,000/year
