# Caching Development Plan

## MVP Caching Priorities

For the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), focus on caching strategies that deliver the highest impact with minimal complexity. Prioritize the following:

1. **API Route Caching for Public/Semi-Static Data**  
   Use Next.js ISR/SSG or the `revalidate` export for API routes serving public or semi-static data (e.g., `/api/prompts/featured`). This reduces database load and improves response times for all users.

2. **Service Layer Caching for Expensive Queries**  
   Cache results of expensive or frequently accessed database queries (e.g., featured prompts, usage stats) using in-memory cache or Redis. This prevents redundant database hits and speeds up responses.

3. **Client-Side Data Fetching with SWR/React Query**  
   Ensure all client data fetching uses SWR or React Query with sensible cache times. Refactor custom hooks (like `usePrompts`) to use these libraries for built-in caching and deduplication.

4. **(Optional) AI/LLM Result Caching**  
   Cache AI/LLM completions for identical prompts to reduce costs and latency. This can be implemented in-memory or with Redis and is especially useful if LLM usage is high.

5. **(Optional) Rate Limiting**  
   Add simple rate limiting to public API endpoints to prevent abuse and protect backend resources. This can be deferred if not immediately needed.

**Summary:**  
Start with API and service layer caching for public and expensive data, then ensure client-side fetches use SWR/React Query. AI/LLM result caching and rate limiting are valuable but can be added after the core MVP is stable.

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement and improve caching across the application to enhance performance, scalability, and user experience. The plan covers API routes, service layer, client-side data fetching, AI/LLM results, and public/static pages.

---

## Goals

- Reduce database and API load by serving cached data where appropriate
- Improve response times for end-users
- Lower operational costs (e.g., LLM API calls)
- Ensure cache consistency and data freshness
- Maintain clean, testable, and secure code

---

## Areas of Focus & Action Steps

### 1. API Route Caching (Server-Side)

- **Goal:** Cache API responses for endpoints serving semi-static or public data.
- **Actions:**
  - Use Next.js ISR/SSG or `revalidate` options for relevant API routes (e.g., `/api/prompts/featured`).
  - Set appropriate HTTP cache headers for public endpoints.
- **Responsible:** Backend/Fullstack Developer

### 2. Service Layer Caching (Distributed)

- **Goal:** Cache expensive or frequently accessed database queries.
- **Actions:**
  - Integrate Redis (or similar) for distributed caching in service files (e.g., `PromptService`, `DashboardService`).
  - Cache results of public prompt queries, featured prompts, and usage stats.
  - Set sensible TTLs and cache invalidation strategies.
- **Responsible:** Backend Developer

### 3. Client-Side Data Fetching

- **Goal:** Ensure all client data fetching uses robust caching and revalidation.
- **Actions:**
  - Refactor custom hooks (e.g., `usePrompts`) to use React Query or SWR for built-in caching and deduplication.
  - Standardize query keys and cache times.
- **Responsible:** Frontend Developer

### 4. AI/LLM API Result Caching

- **Goal:** Avoid redundant LLM API calls for identical prompts.
- **Actions:**
  - Implement caching for AI/LLM completions in the service layer (e.g., Redis with prompt+params as key).
  - Set TTL based on use case and data sensitivity.
- **Responsible:** Backend Developer

### 5. Static Site Generation (SSG) / Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

- **Goal:** Serve static HTML for public, rarely-changing pages.
- **Actions:**
  - Use Next.js SSG/ISR for pages like community prompt details.
  - Set revalidation intervals based on content update frequency.
- **Responsible:** Frontend/Fullstack Developer

### 6. Rate Limiting & Throttling

- **Goal:** Prevent abuse and reduce backend load.
- **Actions:**
  - Add rate limiting to public API endpoints (middleware or API handler level).
- **Responsible:** Backend Developer

## Timeline & Milestones

1. **Week 1:**
   - Audit all API routes and identify candidates for caching/ISR.
   - Set up Redis in development and staging environments.
2. **Week 2:**
   - Implement Redis caching in service layer for prompts and usage stats.
   - Add ISR/revalidate to API routes and public pages.
3. **Week 3:**
   - Refactor client hooks to use React Query/SWR where missing.
   - Implement LLM result caching.
4. **Week 4:**
   - Add rate limiting to public APIs.
   - Write tests for cache hit/miss and invalidation logic.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Stale Data:** Use short TTLs and cache invalidation on data change.
- **Cache Inconsistency:** Use distributed cache for multi-instance deployments.
- **Security:** Never cache sensitive or user-specific data in public/shared caches.

---

## Success Criteria

- Reduced average response time for cached endpoints by 50%+
- Lower database/API call volume (monitor with metrics)
- No major cache-related bugs or stale data incidents
- All caching code is covered by automated tests

---

## Review & Iteration

- Review caching effectiveness after 1 month
- Adjust TTLs, cache keys, and strategies as needed
- Gather feedback from developers and users
