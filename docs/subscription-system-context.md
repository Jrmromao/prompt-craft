# Subscription System Technical Context

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Implementation
The current system has a basic integration between Clerk (authentication) and Stripe (payments), but lacks several critical components for a robust subscription system:

1. **Incomplete Webhook Handling**
   - Only basic webhook events are handled
   - Missing critical events like payment failures
   - No retry mechanism for failed webhook deliveries

2. **Limited Subscription Management**
   - No way to upgrade/downgrade subscriptions
   - Missing billing portal integration
   - Incomplete subscription lifecycle management

3. **Missing Usage Tracking**
   - No way to track feature usage
   - Cannot enforce subscription limits
   - Missing analytics for business insights

4. **Insufficient Error Handling**
   - Basic error handling in place
   - No comprehensive error recovery
   - Missing monitoring and alerting

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Data Consistency
- Need to maintain consistency between Stripe and local database
- Handle race conditions in webhook processing
- Manage subscription state transitions

### 2. Scalability
- Handle high volume of webhook events
- Process usage tracking efficiently
- Manage database performance

### 3. Security
- Secure webhook endpoints
- Protect sensitive payment information
- Implement proper access control

### 4. Reliability
- Ensure webhook delivery
- Handle payment failures gracefully
- Maintain system uptime
