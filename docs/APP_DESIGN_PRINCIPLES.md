# App Design Principles

This document outlines the core design principles and best practices that guide the development of our application. These principles ensure a user experience that is accessible, visually appealing, performant, and secure.

## 1. Accessibility (a11y)
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
- Use ARIA labels and roles for screen readers.
- Sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements.
- Large, clear touch targets for mobile users.
- Semantic HTML for structure and navigation.

## 2. Color Scheme
- Use a consistent, brand-aligned color palette throughout the app.
- Primary actions use the brand's main color (e.g., purple #a855f7).
- Destructive actions (e.g., delete) use red for clarity and safety.
- Muted backgrounds and subtle borders for a calm, modern feel.
- Ensure all color choices meet WCAG AA contrast standards.

## 2a. Typography & Font Choice
- The app uses the Inter font family globally for all headings, UI, and body text.
- Inter is a modern, highly readable, and open-source sans-serif font, inspired by leading SaaS and publishing platforms (such as Medium).
- This choice ensures clarity, consistency, and a premium feel across all devices and screen sizes.
- Font weights (400, 600, 700) are used for clear hierarchy and emphasis.
- Fallbacks include 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, and system sans-serif fonts for maximum compatibility.

## 3. Responsiveness
- The app is fully responsive and works on all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Use flexible layouts (Flexbox, Grid) and relative units (rem, %, vw/vh).
- Test all pages/components on common breakpoints.
- Avoid horizontal scrolling and ensure content adapts gracefully.

## 4. UI/UX Clarity & Simplicity
- Clear headings and labels for all sections and actions.
- Concise, helpful descriptions and tooltips where needed.
- Icons reinforce meaning and improve scanability.
- Sectioned cards or panels for logical grouping.
- Progressive disclosure: show advanced/destructive actions only when needed.

## 5. Feedback & Safety
- All actions provide instant feedback (toasts, banners, spinners).
- Destructive actions require confirmation (modals, typing to confirm).
- Disabled states for buttons during async actions.
- Error messages are clear, actionable, and non-technical.

## 6. Consistency
- Consistent button, card, and form styles across the app.
- Use a design system or component library for UI elements.
- Consistent spacing, font sizes, and iconography.

## 7. Performance
- Optimize images and assets for fast loading.
- Use code splitting and lazy loading for heavy components.
- Minimize reflows and repaints with efficient layout.
- Monitor and improve Lighthouse scores for performance.

## 8. Security & Privacy
- Never expose sensitive data in the frontend.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Use HTTPS for all API calls and secure authentication methods.
- Provide clear privacy controls and data export/delete options.

## 9. Documentation & Maintainability
- All components and utilities are self-documenting or have clear comments.
- Maintain a modular folder structure (components, hooks, services, utils, etc.).
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and files.
- Regularly refactor code for readability and maintainability.

**Summary:**
Our app is designed to be accessible, responsive, visually consistent, performant, and secure. By following these principles, we ensure a delightful and trustworthy experience for all users, on any device.
