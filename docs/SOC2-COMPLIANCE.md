# SOC 2 Compliance - Security Controls

## Overview
This document outlines the security controls implemented to meet SOC 2 Type II compliance requirements.

---

## 1. Access Control (CC6.1)

### API Key Management
✅ **Implemented:**
- API keys hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Keys shown only once at generation
- No storage in localStorage or cookies
- Rate limiting: Maximum 5 keys per user
- Secure random generation (crypto.randomBytes)

**Code:** `/app/api/keys/generate/route.ts`

---

## 2. Logical and Physical Access Controls (CC6.2)

### Authentication
✅ **Implemented:**
- Clerk authentication (industry standard)
- Email verification required
- OAuth support (Google, GitHub)
- Session management
- Automatic logout on inactivity

**Provider:** Clerk (SOC 2 Type II certified)

---

## 3. System Operations (CC7.1)

### Audit Logging
✅ **Implemented:**
- All API key operations logged
- Audit log includes:
  - User ID
  - Action type
  - Resource affected
  - Timestamp
  - Metadata (IP address, key ID)

**Code:** `/app/api/keys/generate/route.ts` (lines 55-68)

**Database:** `AuditLog` table in Prisma schema

---

## 4. Change Management (CC8.1)

### Version Control
✅ **Implemented:**
- Git version control
- Protected main branch
- Code review required
- Automated testing (82 tests)
- CI/CD pipeline

**Platform:** GitHub

---

## 5. Risk Mitigation (CC9.1)

### Rate Limiting
✅ **Implemented:**
- API key generation: 5 keys max per user
- Prevents abuse and resource exhaustion
- Returns 429 status code when limit exceeded

**Code:** `/app/api/keys/generate/route.ts` (lines 24-31)

---

## 6. Data Encryption

### At Rest
✅ **Implemented:**
- API keys: bcrypt hashed (irreversible)
- Database: PostgreSQL with encryption
- Secrets: Environment variables only

### In Transit
✅ **Implemented:**
- HTTPS only (enforced)
- TLS 1.2+ required
- Secure headers (HSTS, CSP)

---

## 7. Data Retention and Disposal

### API Keys
✅ **Policy:**
- Keys stored indefinitely (hashed)
- User can delete keys anytime
- Deleted keys removed from database
- No backup of plain keys

### User Data
✅ **Policy:**
- 30 days retention after account deletion
- Automatic purge after retention period
- User can request immediate deletion (GDPR)

---

## 8. Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
✅ **Implemented:**
- Audit logs for all sensitive operations
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Failed authentication attempts logged
- Anomaly detection (planned)

### Response Plan
✅ **Documented:**
1. Detect: Monitor audit logs
2. Contain: Revoke compromised keys
3. Investigate: Review audit trail
4. Remediate: Patch vulnerabilities
5. Report: Notify affected users

---

## 9. Vendor Management

### Third-Party Services
✅ **SOC 2 Certified:**
- Clerk (Authentication) - SOC 2 Type II
- Vercel (Hosting) - SOC 2 Type II
- Stripe (Payments) - SOC 2 Type II
- PostgreSQL (Database) - Industry standard

---

## 10. Security Testing

### Automated Testing
✅ **Implemented:**
- 82 tests (100% critical path coverage)
- Unit tests for security functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- BDD tests for user flows

**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions runs tests on every commit

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security
1. ✅ Never log plain keys
2. ✅ Hash before storage (bcrypt)
3. ✅ Show only once
4. ✅ Rate limit generation
5. ✅ Audit all operations

### Password Security
1. ✅ Delegated to Clerk (SOC 2 certified)
2. ✅ No passwords stored locally
3. ✅ MFA support available

### Data Protection
1. ✅ Encryption at rest
2. ✅ Encryption in transit
3. ✅ Minimal data collection
4. ✅ GDPR compliant

---

## Audit Trail

All security-relevant events are logged:

```typescript
{
  userId: string,
  action: 'API_KEY_CREATED' | 'API_KEY_DELETED' | 'LOGIN' | 'LOGOUT',
  resource: string,
  resourceId: string,
  metadata: {
    ipAddress: string,
    userAgent: string,
    timestamp: Date
  }
}
```

**Retention:** 90 days minimum
