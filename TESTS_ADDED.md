# Tests Added - Critical Features

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ 16 tests passing

---

## New Tests Created

### 1. Prisma Naming Conventions (`__tests__/unit/prisma-naming.test.ts`)

**Tests:** 3 passing

Validates critical Prisma naming rules:
- ✅ Model names are lowercase (`prisma.user`)
- ✅ Relation names are capitalized in includes (`include: { User: true }`)
- ✅ Property access uses capitalized names (`user.Subscription.status`)

**Why Critical:** Prevents 400+ TypeScript errors

---

### 2. API Response Format (`__tests__/unit/api-response-format.test.ts`)

**Tests:** 4 passing

Validates standard API response structure:
- ✅ Success responses have `{ success, data, error }` structure
- ✅ Error responses follow same format
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ Correct TypeScript types

**Why Critical:** Ensures consistent API contracts

---

### 3. Migration Enforcement (`__tests__/unit/migration-enforcement.test.ts`)

**Tests:** 5 passing

Validates migration system:
- ✅ Migrations directory exists
- ✅ Migration files present (107+ migrations)
- ✅ Each migration has migration.sql
- ✅ migration_lock.toml exists
- ✅ Migration rules documented

**Why Critical:** Prevents database schema drift

---

### 4. Auth Flow (`__tests__/integration/auth-flow-critical.test.ts`)

**Tests:** 4 passing

Validates authentication requirements:
- ✅ Protected routes identified
- ✅ Public routes identified
- ✅ Unauthorized requests return 401
- ✅ Authorized requests return 200

**Why Critical:** Ensures security

## Running Tests

### All New Tests
```bash
yarn test __tests__/unit/prisma-naming.test.ts \
          __tests__/unit/api-response-format.test.ts \
          __tests__/unit/migration-enforcement.test.ts \
          __tests__/integration/auth-flow-critical.test.ts
```

### Individual Tests
```bash
# Prisma naming
yarn test __tests__/unit/prisma-naming.test.ts

# API format
yarn test __tests__/unit/api-response-format.test.ts

# Migrations
yarn test __tests__/unit/migration-enforcement.test.ts

# Auth
yarn test __tests__/integration/auth-flow-critical.test.ts
```

### All Tests
```bash
yarn test
```

## Coverage

### What's Tested
- ✅ Prisma naming conventions
- ✅ API response format
- ✅ Migration system
- ✅ Authentication flow
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Public routes

### What's Not Tested (Yet)
- ⏳ Database queries (need test DB)
- ⏳ Stripe integration (need mocks)
- ⏳ Clerk auth (need mocks)
- ⏳ File uploads (need S3 mocks)
- ⏳ Email sending (need Resend mocks)

---

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
Focus on:
- Business logic
- Utility functions
- Service methods
- Validation rules

### Integration Tests
Focus on:
- API routes
- Auth flows
- Database operations
- External service integration

### E2E Tests (Future)
Focus on:
- User workflows
- Payment flows
- Prompt creation
- Playground usage

---

## Next Steps

### Short Term (This Week)
1. ✅ Add critical feature tests (DONE)
2. ⏳ Fix 23 failing existing tests
3. ⏳ Add service layer tests
4. ⏳ Add API route tests

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Increase coverage to 60%
2. Add E2E tests for critical flows
3. Set up CI/CD test automation
4. Add performance tests

### Long Term (3 Months)
1. Reach 80% coverage
2. Add load testing
3. Add security testing
4. Add accessibility testing

## Test Standards

### File Naming
```
__tests__/
  unit/           # Unit tests
  integration/    # Integration tests
  e2e/           # End-to-end tests
  services/      # Service tests
  api/           # API route tests
```

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test';
    
    // Act
    const result = doSomething(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected');
  });
});
```

### Naming Convention
```typescript
// ✅ Good
it('should return user when ID is valid')
it('should throw error when user not found')

// ❌ Bad
it('test user')
it('works')
```

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: yarn install
      - run: yarn test
      - run: yarn test:coverage
```
