# 🔥 BRUTAL COST PROTECTION ANALYSIS & PLAN

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Repo:** /Users/joaofilipe/Desktop/Workspace/prompt-craft  
**Status:** CRITICAL - MUST IMPLEMENT BEFORE LAUNCH

---

## 🔍 BRUTAL ANALYSIS - WHAT YOU HAVE

### ✅ GOOD (Can Reuse)

1. **Credit System** ✅
   - `app/constants/creditCosts.ts` - Well structured
   - `CREDIT_COSTS` defined per operation
   - `PLAN_MULTIPLIERS` for discounts
   - `calculateCreditCost()` function works

2. **Plan Limits** ✅
   - `app/constants/planLimits.ts` - Comprehensive
   - FREE vs PRO limits defined
   - `hasFeatureAccess()` and `isWithinLimit()` helpers

3. **Usage Tracking** ✅
   - `lib/services/usageTrackingService.ts` - Exists
   - Tracks prompt usage and tokens
   - Has caching (5min TTL)

4. **Database Models** ✅
   - `ApiUsage` - Tracks API calls with tokens
   - `FeatureUsage` - Tracks feature usage
   - `PromptUsage` - Tracks prompt executions
   - `PlanLimits` - Stores plan limits

### 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS (Must Build)

1. **NO REAL-TIME COST TRACKING** 🚨
   - You track tokens but NOT actual $ costs
   - No per-user monthly cost accumulator
   - No alerts when approaching limits

2. **NO HARD COST CAPS** 🚨
   - Users can theoretically spend unlimited $
   - No circuit breaker to stop expensive operations
   - No fallback to cheaper models

3. **NO MODEL-SPECIFIC COST TRACKING** 🚨
   - All models treated equally in credits
   - GPT-4 costs 200x more than DeepSeek!
   - No differentiation in billing

4. **NO COST MONITORING DASHBOARD** 🚨
   - You can't see real-time costs
   - No alerts for unusual spending
   - No projections

5. **NO CACHING LAYER** 🚨
   - Every request hits API (expensive!)
   - Common prompts called repeatedly
   - Could save 80% with Redis cache

### 🟡 WEAK AREAS (Need Improvement)

1. **Credit System Too Simple**
   - Fixed costs don't reflect actual API costs
   - No dynamic pricing based on model
   - No token-based calculation

2. **No Rate Limiting Per Model**
   - Can spam expensive GPT-4 calls
   - No cooldown between requests
   - No queue system

3. **No Cost Estimation**
   - Users don't know cost before running
   - No "this will cost X credits" warning
   - Surprise credit depletion

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Brutal & Minimal)

### Phase 1: CRITICAL (Do First - 2 hours)
**Goal:** Prevent bankruptcy

1. **Create Cost Tracking Service** (30min)
   - Track actual $ costs per user per month
   - Store in database
   - Real-time accumulation

2. **Implement Hard Cost Caps** (30min)
   - $5/user/month maximum
   - Auto-switch to DeepSeek when hit
   - Block expensive models

3. **Add Model Cost Mapping** (30min)
   - Map each model to actual API cost
   - Calculate real $ from tokens
   - Update credit costs dynamically

4. **Create Cost Monitoring** (30min)
   - Admin dashboard showing total costs
   - Per-user cost breakdown
   - Alert system

### Phase 2: IMPORTANT (Do Second - 2 hours)
**Goal:** Optimize costs

5. **Implement Redis Caching** (45min)
   - Cache common prompts
   - 1-hour TTL
   - Save 80% of API calls

6. **Add Cost Estimation** (30min)
   - Show cost before execution
   - "This will cost X credits (≈$Y)"
   - Confirmation for expensive ops

7. **Smart Model Routing** (45min)
   - Default to DeepSeek
   - Premium models opt-in only
   - Suggest cheaper alternatives

### Phase 3: POLISH (Do Third - 1 hour)
**Goal:** User experience

8. **Cost Dashboard for Users** (30min)
   - Show monthly spend
   - Credit usage breakdown
   - Savings from caching

9. **Comprehensive Tests** (30min)
   - Unit tests for cost calculations
   - Integration tests for caps
   - Load tests for limits

## 📋 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Cost Tracking Service (CRITICAL)

**File:** `lib/services/costTrackingService.ts`

**What it does:**
- Tracks actual $ costs per user
- Accumulates monthly totals
- Enforces hard caps
- Provides real-time cost data

**Key functions:**
```typescript
- trackApiCost(userId, model, tokens, cost)
- getUserMonthlyCost(userId)
- isWithinCostLimit(userId, plannedCost)
- enforceHardCap(userId)
- getModelCost(model, inputTokens, outputTokens)
```

### 2. Model Cost Mapping (CRITICAL)

**File:** `app/constants/modelCosts.ts`

**What it does:**
- Maps each model to actual API pricing
- Calculates real $ from tokens
- Updates credit costs dynamically

**Data structure:**
```typescript
MODEL_COSTS = {
  'deepseek-chat': { input: 0.00014, output: 0.00028 },
  'gpt-4-turbo': { input: 0.01, output: 0.03 },
  'claude-3.5': { input: 0.003, output: 0.015 }
}
```

### 3. Hard Cost Caps (CRITICAL)

**File:** `lib/middleware/costLimitMiddleware.ts`

**What it does:**
- Checks user cost before API call
- Blocks if over limit
- Auto-switches to cheap model
- Sends alerts

**Logic:**
```typescript
if (userMonthlyCost + estimatedCost > HARD_CAP) {
  if (model !== 'deepseek-chat') {
    return switchToDeepSeek();
  } else {
    return blockRequest('Monthly limit reached');
  }
}
```

### 4. Redis Caching (IMPORTANT)

**File:** `lib/services/promptCacheService.ts`

**What it does:**
- Caches prompt results
- Checks cache before API call
- Saves 80% of costs

**Key functions:**
```typescript
- getCachedResult(promptHash)
- setCachedResult(promptHash, result, ttl)
- invalidateCache(promptId)
```

### 5. Cost Estimation (IMPORTANT)

**File:** `lib/utils/costEstimator.ts`

**What it does:**
- Estimates cost before execution
- Shows user the cost
- Requires confirmation for expensive ops

**Logic:**
```typescript
const estimatedTokens = prompt.length * 1.3;
const estimatedCost = calculateCost(model, estimatedTokens);
if (estimatedCost > 10) {
  showConfirmation(`This will cost ${estimatedCost} credits. Continue?`);
}
```

2. Plan limits (already good)
3. User auth (unrelated)

### Risk Level: MEDIUM
- Database changes: None
- Breaking changes: Few
- Rollback: Easy
